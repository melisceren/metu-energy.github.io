      <strong>Project Abstract:</strong><br>
      The LEGOFIT project aims to design, implement, and validate an advanced and dynamic integrative approach to accomplish EPH based on smart and innovative solutions with a high scalability and replicability for building construction and renovation, through: i) developing an innovative holistic design platform that encompasses not only passive and active technologies but also their integration for the smartest exchange of information and interoperability of systems based on Building Information Modelling (BIM), available for both professionals and end-users, ii) integrating active and passive strategies (e.g., envelope, HVAC systems, integrated solutions, including nature-based solutions, etc.) with smart management technologies (BAS, BMS) for climate neutral and high-energy building performance, providing maximum flexibility to users iii) investigating innovative routes for promoting minimum environmental impacts by the smart use of solid and liquid residues generated during building life cycle stages and iv) fostering sustainable stock of buildings by guaranteeing not only the fulfilment of sustainable criteria (economic, social, environmental) but also according to the enhancement of smart readiness of buildings. This innovative and integrated approach is demonstrated in 3+ demos across a range of geographical, cultural, and construction stages/technological market maturity scenarios. The building typology focus is the residential sector, multifamily houses, and dormitories, including both new and existing constructions. The involvement of professionals in the sector is ensured through the development of a community of stakeholders and an open innovation community for Building Energy System (BES) professionals. Training courses focused on the new positive energy house approaches will ensure a new generation of multidisciplinary team of experts on the topic.
       
        <strong>Project Details:</strong><br>
        The LEGOFIT project, funded under the Horizon Europe Programme (2023–2027), aims to develop adaptable and scalable solutions for the construction and renovation of Energy Positive Homes (EPH). Central to the project is an integrative design platform that merges passive and active technologies with smart building management systems (BMS), supported by interoperable BIM-based digital environments and building energy models. Through the development of digital twins, stakeholder engagement, and the promotion of circularity, LEGOFIT pursues climate-neutral, high-performance residential buildings. Demonstrated across 5 different European pilots, the project emphasizes replicability, professional training, and open innovation in the energy-efficient housing sector.
        Our research group at METU leads Work Package 2 (WP2) and contributes to two tasks: T2.6 and T4.3. In Task 2.6, METU develops multi-criteria decision-making algorithm that integrates machine learning to evaluate and optimize passive technologies for energy-positive buildings. These algorithms are trained on simulation-derived datasets to deliver fast and accurate performance predictions. An interactive user interface complements this process, enabling end-users to visualize how different envelope configurations affect annual energy consumption, thereby assisting them in selecting the most appropriate construction assemblies for their needs.
        In Task 4.3, METU develops a building energy model–integrated system that supports short-term energy demand prediction. Leveraging machine learning and historical simulation databases, this system forecasts key parameters—such as thermal loads and indoor conditions—to inform real-time control and optimization strategies. These predictive models are integral to the deployment of model predictive control (MPC) techniques and contribute to the LEGOFIT platform’s intelligent building operation capabilities.

      <strong>Project Abstract:</strong><br>
   UP2030 aims to guide cities through the socio-technical transitions required to meet their climate neutrality ambitions. It will do so by enabling a quantum leap from a ´business as usual´, project-by-project decarbonisation approach to a vision-driven, strategy-based approach anchored on sound projects and renewed policy development. The approach uses urban planning and design to create better connected, more compact, net-zero neighbourhoods in the city pilots – i.e., neighbourhoods that promote liveability and, through designing with intent, promote mitigation action. Unlike fragmented innovation processes that focus on the deployment of a specific solution to achieve incremental progress, UP2030 proposes that cities should be at the centre of the innovation approach to drive transformative change. The project develops the 5UP methodological framework that supports cities in (i) UP-dating those policies, codes, regulations that need to be left behind to make room for the new vision (ii) UP-skilling, through building the capacities of the entire city stakeholder ecosystem that shall deliver actions (iii) UP-grading, through the development of solution prototypes (digital and physical) at selected neighbourhoods, (iv) UP-scaling to achieve city-wide impact by shaping the enabling governance arrangements and matching project portfolios to financial resources, and (v) UP-taking, by engaging with the Mission and sharing best practices across European cities. Inclusive participation is key throughout the project’s full cycle of activities so that the real needs of communities are reflected in the city-specific visions and co-designed interventions that maximise the delivery of co-benefits. As such, UP2030 will (a) have a measured positive impact on spatial justice in the pilots and (b) give the opportunity to citizens to participate in the transition by becoming agents of change themselves through their sustainable behavioural shifts.
   
        <strong>Project Details:</strong><br>
     UP2030 is a climate action initiative implemented in 11 pilot cities, including Istanbul, Milan, and Rotterdam, providing practical tools, policy support, and stakeholder strategies to promote sustainability in buildings, mobility, governance, and funding. In Istanbul, the project aims for carbon neutrality by 2050 through positive energy neighborhoods, improved building efficiency, PV integration, and low-carbon mobility using renewable-powered e-bikes, supported by AI technologies like machine learning and digital twins. As METU’s research group, we contribute by developing UBEM/UBTEM, an AI-powered toolset that integrates building energy performance, renewable systems, and micro-mobility to support climate-aware urban decision-making and drive comprehensive decarbonization. You can visit for further information:<a href="https://up2030-he.eu">Website.</a>
    UBEM and UBTEM are AI-powered tools supporting city-scale decarbonization through data-driven, scenario-based decision-making. UBEM focuses on building retrofits, analyzing envelope upgrades, energy systems, and rooftop PV potential using real data to project performance from 2025 to 2050, accounting for climate and economic factors. UBTEM extends this framework to urban e-mobility, optimizing PV-powered e-scooter charging station placement using travel demand and PV data.
    Both tools leverage AI and machine learning to predict energy use, occupant comfort, and financial outcomes. They enable rapid evaluation of retrofit and mobility scenarios, helping cities plan climate adaptation and mitigation strategies while supporting participatory urban planning.
    UBTEM consists of two integrated modules: (1) a building energy model (UBEM) that simulates climate impacts, retrofit scenarios, and PV integration, and (2) a transport module that coordinates e-mobility charging with PV generation and identifies optimal station locations. Built on detailed geospatial datasets, UBTEM addresses CO₂ emissions, aging infrastructure, energy poverty, and rising energy costs.

    <h3>UBEM</h3>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Project Abstract:</strong><br>
        The proposed research aims to develop a machine learning and simulation-assisted KBEM tool. This tool is integrated with a comprehensive database that works with modified climate data and considers climate change and urban heat islands. The tool will make building performance estimates with deep learning models (Convolutional Neural Networks, Multilayer Perceptron). Thus, deep learning models that can make predictions for new samples will be developed with supervised learning from big data sets to be obtained from simulations. In addition, retrofit scenarios will be developed to improve the energy performance, environmental impact, operating cost, and occupant thermal comfort of the buildings. The potential of photovoltaic power generation of existing buildings will also be calculated. Large data sets obtained from numerous simulations will be used for machine learning. With the trained models, retrofit scenarios can be quickly and precisely digitized. The developed KBEM will also be implemented as a web-based prototype interface and will allow the above-mentioned functions by the end user. The tool will be implemented in selected neighborhoods in Ankara and İzmir to develop KBEM models of these neighborhoods. Stakeholder groups will be identified for two KBEMs (representatives from Ankara and Izmir Metropolitan Municipalities and Chamber of Architects), and three workshops will be organized during the project to receive possible expectations and feedback from these groups to verify the KBEM to be developed.
       <strong>Project Details:</strong><br> 
        In cities, effective strategies to improve building energy performance under climate change require tools capable of long-term projections. While physics-based Urban Building Energy Models (UBEM) provide accurate insights, they are limited by discrete future weather data and high computational costs. To address this, the UBEM project (funded by TÜBİTAK 1001, 2021–2023) proposes a hybrid UBEM-assisted machine learning (ML) approach. By simulating a residential district using weather data for the current year, 2050, and 2080, the project generates training and testing datasets to predict heating energy use and indoor overheating more efficiently across multiple years.

      <strong>Project Abstract:</strong><br>
        TRANSMIT addresses the integration of clean energy into buildings through the development of aesthetically appealing, high-performance, semi-transparent photovoltaics (STPV) based on micro-striped CIGS and Perovskite solar cells. By targeting TRL5 within three years, the project aims to develop STPV mini-modules (5×5 cm² and 10×10 cm²) with 8% efficiency and 50% transparency, utilizing a novel micro-structuring process that enables adjustable average visual transparency (30–70%). Unlike conventional solutions, TRANSMIT maintains high power conversion efficiency without sacrificing transparency or introducing unwanted coloration, thanks to full-thickness solar cells and invisible microstriping. Environmental and economic sustainability will be assessed via life-cycle analysis and costing, while the impact on building energy use and thermal comfort will also be evaluated. With 14 project partners, TRANSMIT seeks to surpass the state-of-the-art by delivering scientifically validated, commercially viable, and socially accepted STPV technologies. The project will foster collaboration, ensure stakeholder engagement, and contribute to the widespread adoption of integrated clean energy solutions in the built environment.
       
        <strong>Project Details:</strong><br>
        METU is the partner responsible for analyzing the impact of the developed semi-transparent photovoltaic modules on building-scale energy performance through energy simulation systems. Energy models are being developed based on both theoretical and existing buildings, including residential and non-residential types, to be tested under the climatic conditions of five partner countries. Simulations are carried out using hourly climate data from five cities. The developed semitransparent photovoltaic systems (CIGS and Perovskite modules) will be used in the energy models and compared with conventional windows. Building heating/cooling energy loads (or thermal comfort in non-conditioned spaces) and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions are calculated using EnergyPlus software at both hourly and annual resolutions. Ladybug Radiance software is used to calculate daylight illuminance levels, and this data will be used to estimate artificial lighting demand and the associated energy consumption. Hourly energy supply will be conducted via developed Python code, which is based on Ladybug PV energy calculation method. Then, an analysis of energy flexibility will be conducted using the calculated energy demand and supply.
